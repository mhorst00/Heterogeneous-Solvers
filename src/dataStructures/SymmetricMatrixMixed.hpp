/**
 * Class that represents a symmetric matrix that is stored in a blocked manner.
 * Symmetric values in diagonal blocks are stored redundantly. Otherwise, only
 * the lower triangle of the matrix is stored.
 *
 * The block size can be set via the constructor.
 *
 * Blocks in the lower (blocked) triangle of the matrix are enumerated from top
 * to bottom and from left to right in the matrix. Internally blocks are stored
 * after each other according to their ID. Each block itself is stored in row
 * major layout.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Lower triangle of the symmetric matrix divided into blocks:
 * |---+---+---|
 * | 0 |   |   |
 * |---+---+---|
 * | 1 | 3 |   |
 * |---+---+---|
 * | 2 | 4 | 5 |
 * |---+---+---|
 *
 *
 * Block order in memory:
 *
 * | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
 *
